      <h1 class="mt-5">2021 Competition</h1>
      
      <p> With the unique situation this year, ARC has evolved in the following ways:
         <ul>
          <li>We will be postponing the usual competition til a tentative January 2021 start. This allows us to assess the COVID situation as it evolves. .</li>

          <li>This year's competition will happen in some form, whether virtual or in-person. We have revamped the rulebook and competition structure such that some form of a competition will occur, whether it is within the safe confines of everyone's community or together. Safety of all people involved is our primary priority, and all decision-making will be made with that as our priority.

            Teams that have paid to participate last year will be able to participate free of charge. New teams are welcome to join the competition through the usual financial plan. 
          </li>

          <li>Despite the delay, we will be holding different virtual activities that will be both safe and fun for all participating. We will be using DroneBlocks to give students the opportunity to program and learn how to use drones safely. Furthermore, we will be holding different talks with different speakers who work in the aerospace industry.
          </li>
       </ul>

       Below is a tentative schedule for this year:
       <ul>
          <li> <b>October 1st:</b> Announcement of 2021 competition  </li>
          <li> <b>October 15th:</b> Non-binding registration opens. Rulebook for the 2021 competition will be released. </li>
          <li> <b>October 23rd:</b> Zoom info session to introduce this year's activites and have a Q&A. More information will be announced through  </li>
          <li> <b>November 1st:</b> DroneBlocks material and challenges released  </li>
          <li> <b>mid-November:</b> Virtual ARC talks </li>
          <li> <b>December 15th:</b> Submission for DroneBlocks material is due/results shortly after </li>
          <li> <b>December 15th:</b> Registration Deadline for the 2020 competition </li>
          <li> <b>By the end of December: </b> Teams that are competing this year are announced, and rulebook finalized </li>
          <li> <b> Apr/May 2021 </b> 2021 Competition </li>
       </ul>

      During this fall, we will be holding a fun and exciting virtual activity that will allow students to still participate in drone activities from the safety of their homes! ARC has procured access to DroneBlocks which offers students some lectures and virtual simulations on drone programming and flying! <b>Teams that have already registered have free access to this curriculum.</b> In conjunction with the free access to DroneBlocks, the ARC staff will be coming up with a series of challenges that students can complete. <u>Students that successfully complete these tasks will be able to earn points for their teams that will count towards the actual ARC competition starting in January 2021.</u> More details about DroneBlocks will be released on November 1st. While the challenge is open, ARC will also be hosting interesting and exciting talks by the aerospace industry. Please stay tuned for more information on that!
      <br>
      <br>
      The ARC staff understands the turbulent times that we are currently in, and we hope that these activities will help alleviate some of the pain. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any ideas on what we can do better (aero.robotics.comp@gmail.com).
