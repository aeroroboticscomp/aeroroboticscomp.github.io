      <p>The 2018/2019 Competition will consist of two regional competitions in Florida: one in the Panhandle and one on the coast. </p>

</ul>
<p>The competition challenges are as follows: </p>
      <ol>
  <li>Autonomous Flight:
    <p>Vehicles autonomously fly to waypoints to autonomously complete a task at each waypoint, either loiter or deliver a golf ball payload. Teams will be judged based on the amount of time in which the complete the challenge and the vehicle’s accuracy at each waypoint. </p></li>
      <li>Semi-Autonomous Flight:
    <p>Students pilot their vehicles in head-to-head against other teams to collect k’nex cubes. Pilots will then land their vehicles to disassemble the cubes and build a tower. Teams will be scored based on the number of cubes retrieved and the height of their tower. 
</p></li>
      <li>Technical Communication: 
    <p>Each team presents their vehicle and the details of the design choices. Teams are judged based on their presentation style as well as their design research, problem solving approach and vehicle testing. </p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    The Rule Book contains more details concerning the competition challenges and the vehicle requirements. The team details that will be required for the application are in Appendix C of the Rule Book; the online application will be posted to the website on September 17th.
