<h2>Competition Overview</h2>
<p>This year's competition will be a virtual competition focusing on programming a drone through the help of DroneBlocks. Due to the current COVID situation, we have decided to shift ARC to a virtual format that will allow students to continue to participate in ARC activities without compromising their health. The competition is designed such that the students can collaborate virtually while taking part in aerospace-related activities.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are no separate regions in this year's competition, teams will compete with other teams across the nation!</span>&nbsp;The competition format is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous: The UAV will be required to complete two autonomous missions: an aerobatics challenge and an autonomous mission challenge.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semi-Autonomous: Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel the semi-autonomous portion for the 2020/21 school year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presentation: Teams will demonstrate their understanding of the UAV using core aerospace engineering principles. Creativity is encouraged in their design of the UAV and plan for completing the flight missions; this is where teams can showcase their work.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competition will be centered around the use of the Tello drone.&nbsp;<strong>Teams are not required to purchase Tello drones; however, are highly encouraged. Teams that not purchase the Tello drones will have an opportunity to test their code live in different sessions throughout the year. Additional details will be released in January.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Registration is OPEN:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMf4I3PMZyGX821EAyQy9Qfx1Z0gz0elb5ohl_dZl1bVQd2w/viewform?usp=sf_link">REGISTRATION FORM</a></p>
<p>There will be a $100 fee that will need to be paid before the registration. This will give teams full <a href="droneblocks.io">DroneBlocks</a> access as well as fund the prize money and competition costs.</p>
<p> For schools that participated last year, please reach out to us for details on the entry fee.</p>

<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Q: What is the cost of entry for a team?
<ul>
<li>Teams must pay a $100 entry fee. The $100 goes towards providing DroneBlocks access and competition costs.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: Is there a kit that teams must buy?
<ul>
<li>There is no official equipment that teams must purchase this year. We will be using Tello drones; however, teams are not required to purchase the drones this year. For teams that do not have access to Tello drones, testing opportunities will be provided through virtual sessions where teams can test their code live on actual Tello drones virtually. More details on those sessions will be released in January</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: What are some resources that teams can use to help with the programming portion?
<ul>
<li>Please see this webpage for help:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aeroroboticscomp.com/resources.html">https://www.aeroroboticscomp.com/resources.html</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: Will the virtual engagement point totals carry over?
<ul>
<li>Yes, for schools that had a team entry regardless of final standing, those points will be added to the final total.</li>
