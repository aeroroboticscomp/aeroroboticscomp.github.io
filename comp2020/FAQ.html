      <h2 class="mt-5">2019-2020 Competition Specific Questions</h2>

      <h3 class="mt-5">Autonomous portion</h3>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <h4> How will the (CSV) “waypoint file” be provided to the Team? (on paper?, USB thumb drive, CD, email, other?) please specify.
      </h4>
        <p> It will be delivered through USB thumb drive </p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> How many (number?) waypoints may be expected for the flight path? (the origin, start/return waypoint may be stated as a single waypoint)?
      </h4>
        <p> 5 total waypoints: one delivery waypoint, 3 loiter, and 1 home waypoint</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> What type of surface will the golf ball be delivered? Hard (like concrete/tile) or rough (like a grassy field)?
      </h4>
        <p> It will be on grass</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Will this task be performed inside or outside??
      </h4>
        <p> It will outside since there is no GPS signal inside</p>
      </li>

      </ul> 

      <h3 class="mt-5">Semi-autonomous portion</h3>

      
      <ul>
      <li>
        <h4> Can you provide the dimensions of the “Competition Field”? </h4>
      <h4> Diameter of the competition area (dotted circle in diagram)? </h4>
      </h4>
        <p> 100 ft diameter </p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Shortest distance from the competition area (dotted circle in diagram) to the center tennis ball (# 3 of 5) on the ground? 
      </h4>
        <p> ~25 feet</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Approximate (perpendicular) distance from the “Home Base” (center) to the center-line of (nearest) 5 tennis balls on the ground? 
      </h4>
        <p> Home base will be 10 feet away from the tennis balls.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Distance from the “Home Base” (center) to the center-line of the ball drop “hoops”? 

      </h4>
        <p> 35 feet.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Spacing of the 5 starting tennis balls (on the ground)? 

      </h4>
        <p> 6-7 inches.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Will the 5 tennis balls be arranged as depicted in the diagram of the competition rules?


      </h4>
        <p>Yes</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Are the tennis balls sitting on the ground, or a tennis ball holder? (If tennis ball holder, please describe)


      </h4>
        <p>Cardboard flat holders, drone will have full 180 degree access</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Height of the ball drop hoops from the ground? 


      </h4>
        <p>Between 2 and 4 feet.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Distance from the center point of the competition area to each hoop? Please specify each hoop (L, M, S) and the distance & direction from the competition area center point. 
      </h4>
        <p>10 feet-S, 10 feet-M, 20 feet-L </p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Inside diameter of each of the 3 hoops?
      </h4>
        <p>12”, 16” and 20”</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> If a Team drops a tennis ball and misses a hoop, may the ball be retrieved for another attempt to drop it through a hoop (within the allotted time)? …or only one attempt per tennis ball?

      </h4>
        <p>Correct. A ball may be retrieved if it “missed the hoop”.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Rules state, “During flight, intentional collisions/interference are prohibited. ​Teams causing a collision will be disqualified.” What is that Team disqualified from? The entire Semi-Autonomous portion of the competition? 

      </h4>
        <p>The entire competition.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Does this mean that UNintentional collisions/interference is allowed (or forgiven)? …and will not disqualify a Team?

      </h4>
        <p>Correct. We will have judges to deem whether collisions were intentional or not. If a team is exhibiting any behavior of wreckless flying, we will deem that as “intentional”. However, if a collision is unintentional it will be forgiven and the judges have the right to provide another round for those two teams to compete.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> If an opposing Team causes a “collision” compromising the performance or function (task/time) of our UAV during competition, will our Team be able to repair the damage and re-compete (i.e. do-over) the task?

      </h4>
        <p>Yes. A second flight will be allowed. That second flight will be a “single flight” – i.e. there will not be another drone in the competition field.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Will this task be performed inside or outside?
      </h4>
        <p>Outside. However, in the event there is inclement weather this will occur inside the gymnasium.
        </p>
      </li>

      </ul> 

      <h3 class="mt-5">Presentation</h3>


      <ul>
      <li>
      <h4> Will there be common resources for use by any Team during presentations? Such as easels, small table, (computer) video projector/screen, sound equipment, Wi-Fi, etc. Or will the Team be responsible for all resources as listed?
      </h4>
        <p> The team will only be responsible for submitting their presentation 7 days in advance of the competition to aero.robotics.comp@gmail.com. ARC will provide all other needed presentation supplies.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Will the presentation be conducted inside a room/facility (not outside)? (CA only)
      </h4>
        <p> We have a classroom reserved at Littlerock for the presentations. I have attached a tentative schedule for the day as well.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4> Is each presentation open (for observation) to other people, who are not part of the presenting Team and Judges? (CA only)
      </h4>
        <p> ARC allows observers. Teams are allowed to choose who they want in the room. I.e. a team has the right to tell observers to leave the room.</p>
      </li>

    </ul>

     


      <h2 class="mt-5"> Questions from Office Hours </h2>

      <ul>
      <li>
      <h3> Are teams allowed to use multi-bladed propellers?
      </h3>
        <p> Yes </p>
      </li>
      </ul>  

      <ul>
      <li>
      <h3> What program would you recommend when starting autonomy?
      </h3>
        <p> The tutorials page is a great starting point for teams: <a href="https://arc-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algo.html">Tutorials: Programming</a> </p>
      </li>
      </ul>  

      <ul>
      <li>
      <h3> Is it necessary to cover our electronics with a cover or case for the competition?
      </h3>
        <p> No, though it is highly recommended to at least provide some protection for the electronics </p>
      </li>
      </ul>    

      <ul>
      <li>
      <h3> Can we program a grappling mechanism using Mission planner? 
      </h3>
        <p> Yes: You can connect servos through the Pixhawk itself: <a href="ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-servo.html">Ardupilot Servo Connection </a> 

            This second link should be of interest to teams: <a href="ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-gripper-servo.html">Grappling Mechanism </a>  </p>
