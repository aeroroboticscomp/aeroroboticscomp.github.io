      <p>ARC is an exciting and immersive experience where students will learn many facets of UAV
      operations. 

      The total cost to participate in the competiiton is the following:
      <ol>
          <li> Competition Cost: $400 </li>
          <li> Kit Cost (optional): $600 </li>
      </ol>

      This year, teams can buy a kit. This will ease the hassle and allow teams to receive a fully flyable drone (assembly required) as soon as possible and focus on developing their competition plan and flying. The kit costs $600 and will be built into the financial plan described later. Teams however, are NOT required to purchase a kit, and can go out and look for their own drone; HOWEVER, the drone MUST meet competition requirements to compete.

      In order to fully experience ARC, teams need to have their quadcopter as early into
      the school year as possible. To allow this, teams who are selected to participate will
      immediately get their entire quadcopter kit (the ARC Kit) and be required to pay for it
      throughout the year. This will allow teams to fundraise throughout the year while still preparing for the competition with a fully functioning vehicle. Once a team is selected to participate they, along with their school leadership, are required to sign a financial agreement, below. They must submit this agreement with $100, non-refundable, at which time they will be sent their ARC Kit.

      If a team is selected and does not send back a financial agreement within 5 calendar days they
      will be removed from participation. The following identifies the payment plan:

      Put in table!

      - $100: signed financial plan agreement between the students, teacher, and school
      principal (or equivalent)
      - $200: 4 Nov 2019 ($100 if regionally sponsored)
      - $200: 20 Dec 2019 ($100 if regionally sponsored)
      - $200: 28 Feb 2020 ($100 if regionally sponsored)
      - $300: 4 Apr 2020 ($200 if regionally sponsored)
      If a team decides they no longer want to participate they are simply asked to send back their
      ARC Kit and no more payments will be required. If a team has already made payments totaling
      over $700 they can keep their ARC Kit and will be refunded any money received over $700.
      If a team is late to make payments they must work with the ARC staff on an appropriate path
      forward. No team may be officially placed in a top 3 spot unless they have made payments in
      full.</p>


      <p> Teams may send checks to XXXXXXXXXX or use an online payment system. </p>
